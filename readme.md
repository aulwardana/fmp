# Flood Monitoring Platform (FMP) 


## What is FMP ?
FMP (Flood Monitoring Platform) is a platform that use to manage sensor and data from multiple source. This platform is used to monitoring flood disaster by getting water level data from drainage system. FMP is part of CPSS (Cyber Physical Social System) and IoT (Internet of Things) technology.


## Software Technology
We use some technology to build this platform, there is : 
1. MongoDB
2. PostgreSQL
3. Nginx
4. Mosquito MQTT
5. Golang (Go Programing Language)


## Hardware Technology
We use some technology to build the hardware, there is : 
1. Arduino (IDE and Compiler)
2. NodeMCU with ESP8266
3. HC-SR05 Ultrasonic Sensor
4. Buzzer and LED (Actuator)


## Research Detail
You can get our paper in IEEE, link will be give soon.
